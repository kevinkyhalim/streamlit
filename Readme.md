# Streamlit Demo

This repository is to document my learning on using streamlit.

This is basicaly a beginner streamlit tutorial with the following contents:

1. main.py -> Includes elements such text, images, data, chart, form and also concepts such as Session State, Callbacks, Layouts, Caching, st.rerun(), and Fragments.
2. home.py -> file for testing the in-built page navigation system
3. hom2.py -> file for testing different page navigation system (using drop down and defining your own pages)


From the following link https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/multipage-apps/pages-directory
