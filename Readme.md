# Streamlit Demo

This repository is to document my learning on using streamlit.

A beginner streamlit tutorial with the following contents:
1. main.py -> Includes
   - Elements, such as text, images, data, chart, form; and
   - Concepts such as Session State, Callbacks, Layouts, Caching, st.rerun(), and Fragments.
3. home.py -> file for testing the in-built page navigation system
4. hom2.py -> file for testing different page navigation system (using drop down and defining your own pages)

Check out the different ways to generate a multi page from the following link 
https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/multipage-apps/pages-directory 

To run the file, navigate to the folder and run the following command
```
streamlit run "filename".py
```
